# Linkedin Job Recommender

## Overview

This repository contains the code to implement an automated data pipenline that scraps latest jobs from Linkedin and performs a similarity search between job descriptions and the uploaded resume to return the top 5 most relevant jobs

## Features

- Use Airflow to orchestrate the data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline
  
    - Scrap thousands of job details every day for the desired parameters of job title, location, etc and store as json files on Google Cloud Storage
    - Clean and preprocess raw data in parallel using pyspark. Generate summary statistics about collected jobs using Spark SQL 
    - Store job data and statistics as MongoDB collections
    - Convert job descriptions into word embeddings using Langchain 
       
- A dashboard to display job statistics and recommend relevant jobs

    - Parse user's resume using Google's Cloud Vision API and convert into embeddings using Langchain
    - Filter jobs from database based on the parameters selected by user
    - Perform similarity search between resume text and job descriptions of filtered positions
    - Display the details of top k relevant jobs along with an LLM generated summary explaining why the job description and resume constitute a suitable match

## Guide

`linkedin_dds.py`: 

This contains helper functions to:
- Place and modify normal orders, stop loss orders or gtt orders
- Calculate technical indicators such as bollinger bands and Volume Weighted Average Price
- Fetch historical data and perform error handling

While the helper functions are using the Kite Connect's python client, the main strategy code has been written in a way that one can switch to another platform's API with minimal changes.

`get_jobs_from_api.py`:

This script initializes the data structures and files needed to store trade details and trading parameters relevant to the strategy. 

`gcs_to_mongo.py`:

This script initializes the data structures and files needed to store trade details and trading parameters relevant to the strategy. 

`convert_to_embeddings.py`:

This script uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into the account of kite and fetching the access_tokens for multiple accounts.

`app.py`:

This script fetches daily instrument data and initializes files to store trade details and strategy paramters for a single trading session

`helper.py`:

This script contains the main strategy loop that checks conditions, executes trades and updates the trailing stop loss. The script stops running when either the max no. of cycles is reached or when the trading session concludes. 

`user_definition.py`: 

This contains a simple streamlit dashboard that displays the open positions, completed orders, failer orders and runtime errors.
